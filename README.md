# CssComparer
Simple React app (using Vite and TypeScript) to compare different CSS settings.

It appears that React's current website doesn't even give the instruction as to how to create a new React app but instead directs the user towards one of a handful of frameworks instead. This is a little offputting if someone just wants to learn barebones React from scratch, in my view.

Heck with it, I'm using Vite for this too.
